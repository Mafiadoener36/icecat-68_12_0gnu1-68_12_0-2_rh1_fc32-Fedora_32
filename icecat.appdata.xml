    <p>
      GNU IceCat is the GNU version of the Firefox ESR browser.
    </p>  
    <p>
       Its main advantage is an ethical one: it is entirely free software:
       while the Firefox source code from the Mozilla project is free software,
       they distribute and recommend non-free software as plug-ins and addons.
       Also their trademark license restricts distribution in several ways incompatible with freedom 0.
    </p>
    <p>
       Extensions included to this version of IceCat:
    </p>
     <ul>
       <li>
       LibreJS
          GNU LibreJS aims to address the JavaScript problem described in Richard
          Stallman's article The JavaScript Trap
       </li>
       <li>
       HTTPS Everywhere
          HTTPS Everywhere is an extension that encrypts your communications with many major websites, making your browsing more secure
       </li>
       <li>
       ViewTube
          Watch videos from video sharing websites with extra options
       </li>
       <li>
       A set of companion extensions for LibreJS by Nathan Nichols (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/NateN1222/)
       are pre-installed, and provide workarounds to use some services at USPS, RSF.org, SumOfUs.org, pay.gov, McDonald's, goteo.org
       and Google Docs without using nonfree JavaScript.
       </li>
       <li>
       A series of configuration changes and tweaks were applied to ensure that IceCat does not initiate network connections
       that the user has not explicitly requested. This implies not downloading feeds, updates, blacklists or any other similar
       data needed during startup.
       </li>
      </ul>
